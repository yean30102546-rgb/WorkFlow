## Harness Skills

Claude Code skills for the [Harness.io](https://harness.io/) CI/CD platform. Generate pipeline YAML, manage resources, debug failures, analyze costs, and more from natural language.

This repository is designed as a workflow system, not just a folder of prompts. The top-level instructions (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) establish shared behavior, while individual skills specialize in creation, debugging, governance, and reporting tasks.

## Prerequisites

- [Harness MCP v2 Server](https://github.com/harness/mcp-server) - required for MCP-powered skills. Most skills in this repo depend on it for Harness API access.

## Setup

### Claude Code

Clone the repo and run Claude Code from the project directory. Skills are automatically discovered from `CLAUDE.md` and `skills/*/SKILL.md`:

```
git clone https://github.com/harness/harness-skills.git
cd harness-skills
claude
```

To add the Harness MCP server, configure it in your Claude Code settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`):

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "harness-mcp-v2": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "harness-mcp-v2"],
      "env": {
        "HARNESS_API_KEY": "<your-api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Invoke skills by name:

```
/create-pipeline
Create a CI pipeline for a Node.js app that builds, runs tests,
and pushes a Docker image to ECR
```

### Cursor

1. Clone the repo into your project or as a reference workspace:
```
git clone https://github.com/harness/harness-skills.git
```
2. The repo includes `.cursor/rules/harness.mdc`, which Cursor automatically loads as a project rule.
3. Configure the Harness MCP server in Cursor (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):
```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "harness-mcp-v2": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "harness-mcp-v2"],
      "env": {
        "HARNESS_API_KEY": "<your-api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
4. Reference individual skills in your prompts using `@file`:

```
@harness-skills/skills/create-pipeline/SKILL.md
Create a CI pipeline for my Go service
```

### OpenAI Codex

1. Clone the repo into your working directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/harness/harness-skills.git
```
2. The repo includes `AGENTS.md` at the root, which Codex automatically reads as system instructions.
3. Configure the Harness MCP server in your Codex MCP config:
```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "harness-mcp-v2": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "harness-mcp-v2"],
      "env": {
        "HARNESS_API_KEY": "<your-api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
4. Reference individual skill files as context when prompting:

```
Using the instructions in harness-skills/skills/debug-pipeline/SKILL.md,
diagnose why my deploy pipeline failed
```

### GitHub Copilot

1. Clone the repo into your project:
```
git clone https://github.com/harness/harness-skills.git
```
2. The repo includes `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, which Copilot automatically reads as project-level context in both GitHub.com and VS Code.
3. For VS Code, configure the Harness MCP server in your workspace settings (`.vscode/mcp.json`):
```
{
  "servers": {
    "harness-mcp-v2": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "harness-mcp-v2"],
      "env": {
        "HARNESS_API_KEY": "<your-api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
4. Reference skill files in Copilot Chat using `#file`:

```
#file:harness-skills/skills/create-pipeline/SKILL.md
Create a CI pipeline for my Python service
```

5. For GitHub Copilot on GitHub.com, attach skill files as context in Copilot Chat or add them as knowledge base references in your Copilot organization settings.

### Windsurf / Other AI Editors

The skills in this repo are plain Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. They work with any AI coding tool that supports:

1. **System instructions** - Use `CLAUDE.md` as project-level context.
2. **MCP servers** - Connect the [Harness MCP v2 server](https://github.com/harness/mcp-server) for API access.
3. **File context** - Reference individual `skills/*/SKILL.md` files in prompts.

## Operating Model

The best Harness skills follow the same control flow even when they target different resource types:

1. **Establish scope first** - confirm account/org/project context before listing, creating, updating, or deleting resources.
2. **Verify dependencies before generating dependents** - do not reference connectors, secrets, environments, infrastructure, or templates that have not been confirmed to exist.
3. **Discover schema before writing payloads** - use `harness_describe` and API validation feedback instead of guessing field names or payload shape.

These repo-level playbooks live in:

- [`references/scope-establishment.md`](https://github.com/harness/harness-skills/blob/main/references/scope-establishment.md)
- [`references/dependency-check-playbook.md`](https://github.com/harness/harness-skills/blob/main/references/dependency-check-playbook.md)
- [`references/schema-validation-loop.md`](https://github.com/harness/harness-skills/blob/main/references/schema-validation-loop.md)
- [`templates/operation-summary.md`](https://github.com/harness/harness-skills/blob/main/templates/operation-summary.md)

## Workflow Modes

| Workflow mode | Representative skills | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create and scaffold | `/create-pipeline`, `/create-service`, `/create-connector`, `/create-template` | You need to define or generate new Harness resources and their YAML or MCP payloads. |
| Run and debug | `/run-pipeline`, `/debug-pipeline`, `/migrate-pipeline`, `/manage-delegates` | You already have resources and need to execute, diagnose, or repair behavior. |
| Govern and secure | `/manage-roles`, `/manage-users`, `/create-policy`, `/security-report`, `/audit-report` | You need RBAC, policy, compliance, or security workflows with blast-radius awareness. |
| Analyze and report | `/dora-metrics`, `/analyze-costs`, `/scorecard-review`, `/template-usage` | You need structured reports, summaries, recommendations, or adoption analysis. |

## End-to-End Workflows

### New microservice setup

Use these skills in order:

1. `/create-connector`
2. `/create-secret`
3. `/create-service`
4. `/create-environment`
5. `/create-infrastructure`
6. `/create-pipeline`
7. `/create-trigger`

### Debug a failed deployment

Typical sequence:

1. `/run-pipeline` to identify the latest execution or reproduce the issue
2. `/debug-pipeline` to classify the failure and inspect root cause
3. `/template-usage` if shared templates may have propagated the issue
4. `/manage-delegates` if the failure points to delegate capacity or connectivity

## Shared Playbooks and Templates

Use root-level shared assets for behavior that should stay consistent across many skills:

- `references/` - reusable operating guidance such as scope establishment, dependency verification, and schema-validation loops
- `templates/` - reusable output contracts such as operation summaries and report formats

Use per-skill `references/` or `templates/` when the content is domain-specific and should not be imported broadly.

## Skill Anatomy

Each skill is a directory under `skills/` containing a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter and a consistent markdown body:

```
---
name: my-skill
description: >-
  Explain what the skill does, when to use it, when not to use it, and likely
  trigger phrases. Keep it under 1024 characters.
metadata:
  : Harness
  version: 1.0.0
  mcp-server: harness-mcp-v2
license: Apache-2.0
compatibility: Requires Harness MCP v2 server (harness-mcp-v2)
---

# My Skill

One or two sentences describing the operating mode and expected outcome.

## Instructions

Phase-based steps for Claude to follow.

## Examples

Invocation examples and, for complex skills, brief worked examples.

## Performance Notes

Validation checks, tradeoffs, or speed/accuracy guidance.

## Troubleshooting

Common errors, recovery steps, and expected fallbacks.
```

For complex skills, add `references/` or `templates/` under the skill directory rather than bloating `SKILL.md`.

## MCP Tools

MCP-powered skills use the [Harness MCP v2 server](https://github.com/harness/mcp-server), which provides 10 generic tools dispatched by `resource_type`:

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `harness_list` | List resources |
| `harness_get` | Get resource details |
| `harness_create` | Create a resource |
| `harness_update` | Update a resource |
| `harness_delete` | Delete a resource |
| `harness_execute` | Execute an action |
| `harness_search` | Search across resources |
| `harness_describe` | Get resource schema |
| `harness_diagnose` | Diagnose issues |
| `harness_status` | Check system status |
